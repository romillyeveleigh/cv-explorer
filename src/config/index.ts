Romilly Eveleigh CV
Experienced Front End Developer and Full Stack Developer with a demonstrated history of managing teams and delivering production-ready solutions. 
Skilled in JavaScript, Typescript, React, Redux, Next.js, GraphQL, Apollo, Node.js, Express, Docker, Postgres, MongoDB, Firebase, AWS
(S3, DynamoDB, Codecommit, Lambda), HTML, CSS, and full-stack development. Highly-driven IT professional with a Bachelor's
Degree from the Courtauld Institute, University of London.

I started building my earliest websites whilst I was still a teenager. I've always been driven by a desire to figure out how things
work and solve technical problems. So far, coding has been the perfect match for me. My first commercial project was creating a
custom database-driven e-commerce site for my employer in just a few weeks. Since then, my knowledge-base has steadily
grown through a combination of self-study, persistence and practical experience.

Outside of software development, I have extensive experience working as a Project Manager, coordinating small teams,
managing budgets and delivering complex projects on time and to a high standard.

Nowadays, I like to use Next.js and React due to its active user community and excellent component libraries, but I can quickly
learn whatever stack is necessary. With the right tools for the job and my adaptability, I'm confident to tackle any task.
